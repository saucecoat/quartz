>**Key points from this video:**
>
>[2:32](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=152s) Examples of bad slides.  
>[3:46](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=226s) "90% of what you said was gone in 30 seconds" if your slides looked like these bad examples.  
>[6:15](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=375s) One message per slide!  
>[7:20](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=440s) "1 + 1 = 0" -> "Redundancy Effect" -> If what you're saying (verbal script) is also written on your slides, your audience will get 0 info.  
>[8:05](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=485s) Purpose of your slides: short, sweet bit of text and an image.  
>[8:36](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=516s) Your eyes focus on moving objects, signaling colours (red/orange/yellow), contrasting objects, and big objects.  
>[9:32](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=572s) Slide title is often the biggest object, but rarely the most important.  
>[10:26](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=626s) The biggest parts of your slides should be the most important part of your presentation.  
>[10:40](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=640s) U S E C O N T R A S T to control your audience's attention.  
>[10:46](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=646s) Don't use light backgrounds. Use dark backgrounds and light text! Light background steal too much attention (e.g., from the speaker).  
>[14:12](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=852s) Your brain needs to "count" if there are 7 or more objects, but not if there are only 6 or fewer. Your brain can simply "see" the 6 objects.  
>[14:42](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=882s) Counting takes 500% more cognitive resources than just seeing.  
>[15:40](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=940s) The magic number is 6. The max number of objects per slide should be 6.  
>[18:28](https://www.yewtu.be/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo&t=1108s) The number of slides is rarely the problem. The problem is often the number of objects per slide.
