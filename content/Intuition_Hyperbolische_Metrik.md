A good way to imagine [[The_Beautiful_Story_of_Non-Euclidean_Geometry|hyperbolic space]] is this: in the middle you have a special height. And the further you go to the "boundary" the smaller you get. Then your steps would be smaller and you would never reach the limit. 
Also, if you want to make a shortcut, like Brady suggested, you would get further away from the middle, therefore you would get smaller, and the way would take longer to go.
